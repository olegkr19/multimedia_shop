  The term multimedia is also often used to refer to storage media that allow you to store significant amounts of data and provide fairly quick access to them (the first carriers of this type were CDs). In this case, the term multimedia means that the computer can use such media and provide information to the user through all possible types of data, such as audio, video, animation, image and others, in addition to traditional methods of providing information, such as text.
  Multimedia can be roughly or gently classified as linear and non-linear.
An analog of the linear way of presentation can be a movie. A person viewing this document in no way can affect its output.
A non-linear way of presenting information allows a person to participate in the output of information, interacting in some way with a means of displaying multimedia data. Human participation in this process is also called "interactivity." This method of human-computer interaction is most fully represented in the categories of computer games. A non-linear way of presenting multimedia data is sometimes called “hypermedia”.
As an example of a linear and non-linear way of presenting information, one can consider a situation such as a presentation. If the presentation was taped and shown to the audience, then with this method of delivering information, viewers of this presentation are not able to influence the speaker. In the case of a live presentation, the audience has the opportunity to ask the speaker questions and interact with him in a different way, which allows the speaker to move away from the topic of the presentation, for example, explaining some terms or highlighting the controversial parts of the report in more detail. Thus, a live presentation can be presented as a non-linear (interactive) way of presenting information. ',
